# WebCrawler_java
Hi !!
This is just a small web crawler to search for a particular word on a website.
This is my first crawler so please expect numerous flaws in it but it works pretty well!!
There are basically two classes Spider ( class containing the main function) and Spiderleg( contains the functionalities).

If you wish to clone my Project .. make sure you have jsoup installed and do provide the classpath to the jar file while compiling and executing the java program.

Cheers to Crawling!!
